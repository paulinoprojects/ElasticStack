## Create Your Own Elastic Stack Lab

Setting up an Elastic Stack lab involves deploying Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Beats (optional) in a controlled environment, where you can explore the stack and experiment with threat detection, log management, and more.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

To begin, you'll need to set up virtual machines (VMs) or use cloud services to host each component of the Elastic Stack:

- **1 VM** for **Elasticsearch** (2-4GB of RAM recommended)
- **1 VM** for **Logstash**
- **1 VM** for **Kibana** (1-2GB of RAM)
- **System Requirements**:
  - **CPU**: 2+ cores
  - **RAM**: 8GB or more for better performance
  - **Disk**: SSD recommended for faster storage (20GB per VM)

You can use **VirtualBox**, **VMware**, or any cloud platform (e.g., **AWS** or **Google Cloud**) to create the VMs.

### Step 2: Install Elasticsearch

1. Go to the [Elastic Downloads Page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and download the appropriate version for your OS.
2. Follow the installation guide for your system (Windows, Linux, macOS) in the [Elasticsearch Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html).
3. Run Elasticsearch and verify that it's accessible at `http://localhost:9200/`.

### Step 3: Install Logstash

1. Go to the [Elastic Downloads Page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash) and download Logstash.
2. Install Logstash on a separate VM.
3. Use the [Logstash Configuration Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/index.html) to configure Logstash to collect and send data to Elasticsearch.
4. Test the configuration by sending sample log data to Elasticsearch.

### Step 4: Install Kibana

1. Download Kibana from the [Elastic Downloads Page](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana).
2. Install Kibana on another VM.
3. Configure Kibana by editing the `kibana.yml` file to point to your Elasticsearch instance.
4. Run Kibana and access it via `http://localhost:5601`.

### Step 5: Ingest Sample Data

- Use **Elastic Beats** (e.g., **Filebeat**, **Packetbeat**) or **Logstash** to ingest sample log data into Elasticsearch. For example, you can use **Filebeat** to collect system logs and send them to Elasticsearch for analysis.

### Step 6: Build Dashboards in Kibana

1. Once the data is ingested into Elasticsearch, use **Kibana** to create dashboards.
2. Create visualizations such as:
   - Event counts
   - Error rates
   - Security-related logs (e.g., failed login attempts)
3. Customize the dashboards for your security monitoring needs.

### Step 7: Implement Elastic Security

1. Set up **Elastic Security** in Kibana to start using threat detection and monitoring features.
2. Create custom detection rules based on network or log data to identify suspicious activities.
3. Use machine learning for anomaly detection in your data.

### Step 8: Monitor and Analyze Logs

- Use Kibana's alerting features to monitor logs in real-time and respond to security events. Set up automated alerts based on detection rules you've created.
